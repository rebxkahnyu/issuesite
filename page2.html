        <h2>life of a trainee</h2>
        <p id="paragraphs">waking up at 5am for dance practice before going to school. having your weight announced to the rest of the group. being called by a number. sleeping in cramped dorms. having to be a certain weight despite height or age. passing out often during practices. it's a different experience for every trainee, but it's true that they are all under intense pressure and are all competing with one another. these kids have to stand out in a field full of others their age, with people in charge disregarding their mental and physical health in the name of fame.</p>

        <h2>public image</h2>
        <p id="paragraphs">i'm making a generalization here and not all idols might experience this, but idols are pressured to stay single, take on a specific personality, and/or please their fans as much as possible. no company would want their idols to expose any bad treatment or practices (although idols have), and diet and weight are heavily monitored. these are all givens for becoming a celebrity, but it still ticks me off to see idols acting cute (or "doing aegyo") when they clearly do not want to. it also sucks to know that many idols may be faking a personality or are being forced to act a certain way. k-pop idols are also encouraged (or forced) to get plastic surgery and white-wash their skin. in some groups, you can see how all the members have the exact same pale skin shade.</p>

        <h2>mental health (tw: suicide)</h2>
        <p id="paragraphs">fans cyberbullying idols is not uncommon (and is very common amongst fans) which leads to poor mental health in a country that stigmatizes it. there are many cases of harassment, stalking, and targeting against idols, and some have taken their own lives in the past. sulli of f(x)'s death was linked to cyberbullying and malacious comments, and someone who grieved her death (goo hara of kara) took her own life a month later. kim jong hyun of shinee said the pressures of the industry had led to a depression he couldn't overcome. these idols don't get the help they need, and are discouraged against speaking up about their issues in fear of losing face.</p>

        <p id="paragraphs">there are many minors in the k-pop industry, some of whom are sexualized by consumers. especially for female idols, they can be pressured into prostitution and/or sexually abused by people in power without ever revealing it to anyone in fear of losing their careers.</p>
